# sim808_gps_tracker
in this project we use sim808 and arduino uno to build a gps tracker which user can see the tracking log on a website.
In the following i will show you how to do the each part.

## arduino
for the hardware part i use arduino uno and [sim808-module](https://www.amazon.de/TECNOIOT-SIM808-Module-Development-Antenna/dp/B083M5VBQT) , this also work on other arduino board but you need to make some changes in code and wiring.
you can power up the sim808 with 5-26V, 2A, 5.5mm adapter. also you can use 3.7 18650 li-lon battery.
i personally use 20000 powerbank with 5V, 2.4A output, for both arduino uno and sim808 module.
i upload two arduino code, That both works fine and both them can send the location to php secript ervery 10S feel free to use either of them but here is one example.
```

```python
import foobar
```
